An automation script that gathers headlines from a set of news sources, sends it to an Email address, and builds an archive of daily news.

The dataset enables the following analysis:
1. Track political figures: "How often is 'Scholz' mentioned vs 'Merz'?"
2. Monitor crisis sentiment: "How did sentiment about inflation change in 2024?"
3. Geographic analysis: "Which German cities appear most in economic news?"
4. Source bias detection: "Does Tagesschau report more positively on EU topics than other sources?"
