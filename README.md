# zeitgeist
a news gatherer and archive, providing daily briefings and perspective

The dataset enables the following analysis:
1. Track political figures: "How often is 'Scholz' mentioned vs 'Merz'?"
2. Monitor crisis sentiment: "How did sentiment about inflation change in 2024?"
3. Geographic analysis: "Which German cities appear most in economic news?"
4. Source bias detection: "Does Tagesschau report more positively on EU topics than other sources?"
